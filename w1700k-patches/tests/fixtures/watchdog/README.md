# procd watchdog source fixture

`watchdog.c.fixture` is unchanged official procd source at `fb6116870115a66686709017ecabfd724804bbdf`, selected by both distribution recipes.

Tests apply the production patch and compare all source bytes outside the explicit changes. Private regular files additionally exercise host libc file/conversion primitives via ctypes. The Python glue is an oracle, not execution of compiled procd C, musl or watchdog ioctls. No host `/dev/watchdog` or sysfs files are accessed.

`system.c.fixture` pins the same procd revision's frequency-before-timeout call order; `uloop.c.fixture` pins libubox `a396f38a8568a1d670c240465cd8d24fdfdf6463`. Their SHA256 values are asserted in the suite. `frequency_contract.py` checks complete patched functions before applying a numeric protocol oracle for accepted/rejected timeouts, pending timers, stopped requests and last-confirmed fallback. A failed readback is not a fresh hardware observation; a device with no confirmed timeout remains unverified.
